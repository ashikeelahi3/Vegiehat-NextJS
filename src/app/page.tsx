        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
        In Bangladesh, unpredictable food prices often create challenges for families trying to make ends meet. Factors like natural disasters, market manipulation, and global supply chain disruptions contribute to these fluctuations. Our mission with VEGIEHAT is to empower communities by providing them with the tools to monitor and report market prices collectively. By doing so, we aim to foster accountability and ensure everyone has access to essential goods at fair prices.
